This is an older post discussing some general thoughts on web design principles.

## Key Principles

1.  **Clarity**: The design should clearly communicate its message.
2.  **Simplicity**: Avoid unnecessary complexity. Less is often more.
3.  **User-Centricity**: Always design with the user in mind.

## A List of Ideas

- Mobile-first approach
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimization
