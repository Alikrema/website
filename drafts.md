        <p>My life has followed a typical "gifted child" trajectory. I come from a working class family in Cairo, Egypt, was top of my class for years, and then joined a <strong> top-notch, cut-throat, hyphenated-adjective high school (STEM Schools) that led to an even-more-hyphenated-cutter-throat college (UPenn)</strong>, which lead to many challenges and self-exploration along the way. Soon enough, I learned the hard way that not all my childhood wiring — perfectionism, seeking external validation, etc. — was my real identity. And I've been trying to figure it out ever since.
